Introduction:
Whatsapp has quickly become the worldâ€™s most popular text and voice messaging application. Specializing in cross-platform messaging with over 1.5 billion monthly active users, this makes it the most popular mobile messenger app worldwide.

Without media: exports about **40k messages **
With media: exports about 10k messages along with pictures/videos
While exporting data, avoid including media files because if the number of media files is greater than certain figure then not all the media files are exported.

Opening this .txt file up, you get messages in a format that looks like this:
